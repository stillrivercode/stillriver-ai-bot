## How to Use

### 1. Choose an Example
Select the custom rules file that best matches your project type and requirements.

### 2. Copy to Your Repository
Copy the chosen JSON file to your repository, typically in a `.github/` or `docs/` directory:

```bash
cp examples/custom-rules-security-focus.json .github/custom-review-rules.json
```

### 3. Customize the Rules
Edit the copied file to match your specific requirements:

```json
{
  "title": "Your Project Security Review",
  "description": "Custom security review for your specific needs",
  "guidelines": [
    "Your specific guidelines here"
  ],
  "focusAreas": [
    "Your focus areas"
  ],
  "additionalInstructions": "Any additional context or requirements"
}
```

### 4. Configure Your Workflow
Update your GitHub Actions workflow to use the custom rules:

```yaml
- name: AI PR Review
  uses: stillrivercode/stillriver-ai-bot@v1
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    openrouter_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
    model: 'anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet'
    review_type: 'security'  # or 'performance', 'comprehensive'
    custom_review_rules: '.github/custom-review-rules.json'
```

## Custom Rules Structure

Custom review rules files use the following JSON structure:

```json
{
  "title": "Review Title (overrides base review type title)",
  "description": "Description of the review focus",
  "guidelines": [
    "Specific guidelines for reviewers to follow",
    "Each guideline should be actionable and clear"
  ],
  "focusAreas": [
    "Specific areas to pay attention to",
    "These appear as bullet points in the review prompt"
  ],
  "examples": [
    "Concrete examples of what to look for",
    "Best practices to suggest"
  ],
  "additionalInstructions": "Free-form additional context and instructions"
}
```

### Field Descriptions

- **title** *(optional)*: Overrides the default review type title
- **description** *(optional)*: Brief description of the review's purpose
- **guidelines** *(optional)*: Array of specific review guidelines
- **focusAreas** *(optional)*: Array of areas to focus on during review
- **examples** *(optional)*: Array of concrete examples or suggestions
- **additionalInstructions** *(optional)*: Free-form additional context

### Merging Behavior

Custom rules are merged with base review configurations:
- If a field is provided in custom rules, it overrides the base configuration
- If a field is missing, the base configuration is used as fallback
- This allows for partial customization while maintaining sensible defaults

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific
- Use concrete, actionable guidelines
- Provide specific examples relevant to your codebase
- Focus on measurable outcomes

### 2. Maintain Consistency
- Use consistent terminology across your custom rules
- Align with your team's coding standards and practices
- Keep the language clear and professional

### 3. Regular Updates
- Update custom rules as your project evolves
- Incorporate lessons learned from previous reviews
- Remove outdated or irrelevant guidelines

### 4. Team Collaboration
- Involve your team in creating and maintaining custom rules
- Review and discuss the effectiveness of custom rules regularly
- Consider different rules for different types of changes (features, bug fixes, refactoring)

## Troubleshooting

### File Not Found
If you get a "file not found" error:
- Verify the path in your workflow is correct
- Ensure the file is committed to your repository
- Check file permissions and accessibility

### Invalid JSON
If you get a JSON parsing error:
- Validate your JSON syntax using a JSON validator
- Check for trailing commas, missing quotes, or other syntax errors
- Ensure all strings are properly escaped

### No Effect
If custom rules don't seem to be applied:
- Check the action logs for warnings about loading custom rules
- Verify the file structure matches the expected format
- Ensure you're using a compatible version of the action

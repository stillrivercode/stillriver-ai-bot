# Refactoring Prompt Template

## Task: Code Refactoring

### Refactoring Details

- **Target Code**: {TARGET_CODE}
- **Refactoring Goal**: {REFACTORING_GOAL}
- **Current Issues**: {CURRENT_ISSUES}
- **Desired Improvements**: {DESIRED_IMPROVEMENTS}
- **Constraints**: {CONSTRAINTS}

### Refactoring Guidelines

1. **Preserve Functionality**
   - Maintain exact same behavior
   - Don't change public APIs without documentation
   - Ensure all existing tests continue to pass
   - Verify no breaking changes introduced

2. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Improve readability and maintainability
   - Remove code duplication
   - Simplify complex logic
   - Extract reusable components/functions
   - Improve naming conventions

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Optimize algorithms where beneficial
   - Reduce memory usage if applicable
   - Improve database query efficiency

4. **Architecture Improvements**
   - Better separation of concerns
   - Improved modularity
   - Clearer dependency management
   - Enhanced testability

### Testing Strategy

- [ ] Run existing test suite before refactoring
- [ ] Ensure all tests pass after refactoring
- [ ] Add tests for any new functions/methods
- [ ] Verify performance improvements with benchmarks
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions

### Documentation Updates

- [ ] Update inline comments
- [ ] Revise API documentation
- [ ] Update architecture diagrams
- [ ] Record performance improvements

### Deliverables

- [ ] Code refactored according to goals
- [ ] All existing functionality preserved
- [ ] Tests updated and passing
- [ ] Performance improvements documented
- [ ] Code quality metrics improved
- [ ] Documentation updated

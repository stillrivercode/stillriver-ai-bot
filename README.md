# AI Workflows

An AI-powered GitHub workflow automation tool with AI Resolvable Comments and Information Dense Keywords integration.

## Getting Started

To use this action, create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/ai-review.yml`) in your repository with the following content:

```yaml
name: AI PR Review

on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, labeled]

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: AI PR Review
        uses: stillrivercode/stillriver-ai-workflows@v1
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          openrouter_api_key: ${{ secrets.OPENROUTER_API_KEY }}
          model: ${{ vars.AI_MODEL || 'google/gemini-2.5-pro' }}
          review_type: 'full'
          max_tokens: 32768
          temperature: 0.7
```

## AI Resolvable Comments

This action features an advanced AI review system that generates **GitHub's native resolvable suggestions**, transforming AI feedback into actionable, one-click applicable code changes.

### Key Features

- **üéØ Confidence-Based Suggestions**: Multi-factor scoring algorithm evaluates Issue Severity (40%), Static Analysis (30%), Code Context (20%), and Historical Patterns (10%)
- **‚ú® Native GitHub Integration**: High-confidence suggestions (‚â•95%) become GitHub's resolvable suggestions with one-click application
- **üìä Intelligent Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 resolvable suggestions per PR to prevent cognitive overload
- **üéöÔ∏è Graduated Response**: Different presentation formats based on confidence levels

### Confidence Thresholds

| Confidence | Type | Description |
|------------|------|-------------|
| **‚â•95%** | üîí Resolvable | Critical issues that become GitHub's native resolvable suggestions |
| **80-94%** | ‚ö° Enhanced | High-confidence recommendations with detailed context |
| **65-79%** | üí° Regular | Medium-confidence informational comments |
| **<65%** | ‚ÑπÔ∏è Suppressed | Low-confidence suggestions aggregated into summary |

### Available Commands

```bash
# Complete AI review workflow with resolvable comments
npm run ai-review-resolvable

# Analyze code changes and generate suggestions
npm run ai-review-analyze

# Demonstration of suggestion formatting
npm run ai-review-demo

# Direct script access for PR analysis
./scripts/ai-review-resolvable.sh analyze --pr-number=123
```

## Inputs

See `action.yml` for a full list of inputs. For details on how to use `custom_review_rules` and understanding the prompt structure, see [docs/prompt-template-structure.md](docs/prompt-template-structure.md).

### Required Parameters

- `github_token`: Your GitHub token for API access
- `openrouter_api_key`: Your OpenRouter API key for AI model access

### Comment Posting

**By default, the action automatically posts review comments to your PR.**

Set `post_comment: false` if you only want to use the review content via outputs without posting a comment. This allows for maximum flexibility in how you handle the review content.

### `github_token` Permissions

This action requires the `pull-requests: write` permission to post review comments. You can grant this permission in your workflow file:

```yaml
permissions:
  pull-requests: write
```

## How It Works

### Input Types Note

While the input descriptions in `action.yml` use semantic types like `number` or `string` for clarity, all GitHub Actions inputs are received as strings. The action handles the necessary parsing and validation internally. For example, `max_tokens` and `temperature` are parsed from strings to numbers with appropriate validation.

### AI Review Types

The action supports different review types that tailor the AI's focus:

- **`full`** (default): Comprehensive review covering bugs, improvements, security, and code style
- **`security`**: Focused on identifying security vulnerabilities
- **`performance`**: Focused on identifying performance issues

### Review Deduplication

The action automatically prevents duplicate reviews by checking for existing AI reviews on the pull request. If an AI review (containing "## ü§ñ AI Review by") already exists from the `github-actions[bot]` user, the action will skip the review and set `review_status` to `skipped`.

### AI Review Format

AI reviews with resolvable comments feature:
- **Resolvable Suggestions**: High-confidence suggestions (‚â•95%) appear as GitHub's native resolvable suggestions with one-click application
- **Enhanced Comments**: Medium-high confidence suggestions (80-94%) provide detailed context and rationale
- **Graduated Response**: Different presentation formats based on confidence levels
- **Rate Limiting**: Maximum 5 resolvable suggestions per PR to prevent cognitive overload
- **Summary Reports**: Comprehensive analysis with categorized suggestions and confidence metrics

### Review Status

The action sets the `review_status` output to indicate the result:

- **`success`**: Review was generated and posted successfully
- **`skipped`**: Review was skipped (duplicate review exists, no changed files, or no files after filtering)
- **`failure`**: An error occurred during the review process

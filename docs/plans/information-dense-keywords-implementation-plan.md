# Information Dense Keywords Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation status of `@stillrivercode/information-dense-keywords` as the standardized AI command system for this repository. The package has been successfully integrated and is now the primary command vocabulary for AI interactions.

## Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETED

The IDK system has been successfully implemented and is operational. This document now serves as a reference for the completed implementation.

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Package Setup ✅ COMPLETED
1. **✅ Install Package**: Package installed at version ^1.7.2
2. **✅ Add Scripts**: npm scripts configured (`npm run idk`, `npm run idk:update`)
3. **✅ Update CLAUDE.md**: Updated with comprehensive IDK command reference

### Phase 2: Command Integration ✅ COMPLETED
Successfully integrated IDK commands throughout the project:

| Legacy Reference | IDK Command | Status | Usage |
|-----------------|-------------|--------|-------|
| analyze-issue.sh | `analyze this issue` | ✅ Implemented | Issue analysis and requirements gathering |
| create-epic.sh | `create epic` + `plan this implementation` | ✅ Implemented | Epic creation with planning |
| create-spec.sh | `spec this [system]` | ✅ Implemented | Technical specification generation |
| create-user-story.sh | `create user story` | ✅ Implemented | User story creation |
| generate-spec.sh | `spec this [feature]` | ✅ Implemented | Feature specification |
| generate-user-story.sh | `create user story` | ✅ Implemented | User story generation |

### Phase 3: GitHub Actions Integration ✅ COMPLETED
IDK commands are now used throughout AI workflows:
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ai-task.yml` - Uses IDK command parsing
- ✅ `.github/workflows/ai-pr-review.yml` - Integrated with IDK vocabulary
- ✅ All AI-powered workflows updated

### Phase 4: Documentation Updates ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ CLAUDE.md updated with full IDK command reference
- ✅ docs/information-dense-keywords.md created with complete dictionary
- ✅ docs/AI.md updated with IDK usage patterns
- ✅ Comprehensive command dictionary in docs/dictionary/ structure

## Benefits

### Standardization
- Consistent command vocabulary across all AI assistants

- Reduced ambiguity in command interpretation

### Maintainability
- External package maintenance (no custom shell scripts)
- Built-in GitHub integration
- Command chaining capabilities

### Scalability
- 20+ predefined commands across multiple categories
- Extensible architecture
- Quality assurance features

## Implementation Timeline ✅ COMPLETED

### Week 1: Foundation ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Install and configure IDK package
- ✅ Update package.json scripts
- ✅ Test basic command functionality

### Week 2: Integration ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Update CLAUDE.md with IDK commands
- ✅ Modify GitHub Actions workflows
- ✅ Test AI workflow integration

### Week 3: Documentation and Testing ✅ COMPLETED

- ✅ Validate AI assistant compatibility

## Current Status & Maintenance

The IDK system is fully operational and being actively used:

1. **Package Management**: Use `npm run idk:update` to update to latest IDK version
2. **Command Reference**: Full dictionary available at `docs/information-dense-keywords.md`
3. **AI Integration**: All workflows use standardized IDK vocabulary
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides in `docs/AI.md` and `CLAUDE.md`

## Future Enhancements

## Labeling Guidelines

### Mandatory Labels

Every issue should have:

1. **One priority label** (`critical`, `high`, `medium`, `low`)
2. **One type label** (`bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, etc.)

### Optional Labels

Add as appropriate:

- **Scope labels** to categorize by area of impact
- **Status labels** to track progress
- **Special labels** for community or process needs

### Labeling Examples

#### Security Issue

```text
Labels: critical, security, workflow, phase-1, ready
```

#### Documentation Enhancement

```text
Labels: medium, documentation, phase-1, good-first-issue
```

#### Performance Bug

```text
Labels: high, bug, performance, ai-task, needs-info
```

## Label Management

### Creating Labels

Use the GitHub CLI to create labels:

```bash
# Priority labels
gh label create "critical" --color "B60205" --description "Must be fixed immediately"
gh label create "high" --color "D93F0B" --description "Should be fixed soon"
gh label create "medium" --color "FBCA04" --description "Normal priority"
gh label create "low" --color "0E8A16" --description "Nice to have"

# Type labels
gh label create "security" --color "B60205" --description "Security-related issues"
gh label create "performance" --color "D4C5F9" --description "Performance improvements"
# ... (see scripts/create-labels.sh for complete list)
```

### Applying Labels

```bash
# Add labels to an issue
gh issue edit 20 --add-label "critical,security,workflow"

# Remove labels from an issue
gh issue edit 20 --remove-label "needs-info"
```

### Automated Labeling

The AI task workflow automatically applies labels:

- `ai-task` label is added to all AI-generated issues
- Branch prefix determines additional labels (e.g., `feat/` → `enhancement`)

## Best Practices

### For Issue Creators

1. **Always add priority and type labels**
2. **Use descriptive titles** that don't require reading the full issue
3. **Add scope labels** to help with project organization
4. **Update labels** as issue status changes

### For Maintainers

1. **Review labels weekly** to ensure consistency
2. **Clean up unused labels** periodically
3. **Document any new labels** added to this guide
4. **Use label filters** for project planning and triage

### For Contributors

1. **Check existing labels** before creating new ones
2. **Ask for label changes** if current labels don't fit
3. **Use `good-first-issue`** filter to find beginner-friendly tasks
4. **Watch for `help-wanted`** labels on issues you can assist with

## Label Analytics

Use GitHub's label filtering to track:

- **Critical issues**: `label:critical` - for urgent attention
- **Phase 1 work**: `label:phase-1` - roadmap tracking
- **Security items**: `label:security` - security audit
- **Documentation gaps**: `label:documentation` - content planning
- **Community contributions**: `label:good-first-issue OR label:help-wanted`

This labeling system helps maintain organization, improve discoverability, and facilitate effective
project management across all phases of development.

# Technical Specification: AI Resolvable Comments

## Overview

This specification defines the implementation of resolvable AI code review suggestions in GitHub pull requests, transforming passive AI comments into actionable workflow gates that require explicit developer decision-making.

## Objectives

### Primary Goals
- **Intentional Review**: Force conscious consideration of AI suggestions
- **Audit Trail**: Create permanent record of suggestion handling decisions
- **Quality Gate**: Prevent critical issues from being overlooked
- **Developer Efficiency**: Enable one-click application of valid suggestions

### Success Metrics
- **Resolvable Suggestion Acceptance Rate**: Target 85-95% for critical confidence (≥95%) suggestions
- **Enhanced Comment Engagement**: Target 60-75% developer interaction rate for high confidence (80-94%) comments
- **Review Velocity**: Maintain or improve current PR review times
- **Developer Satisfaction**: >85% positive feedback on feature utility with minimal friction
- **Issue Prevention**: Measurable reduction in critical bugs reaching production

## Confidence Scoring Framework

### Scoring Criteria

| Factor | Weight | High Score Indicators |
|--------|---------|----------------------|
| **Issue Severity** | 40% | Security vulnerabilities, logic errors, null pointer risks |
| **Static Analysis Confidence** | 30% | Definitive rule violations, type mismatches |
| **Code Context Clarity** | 20% | Clear function scope, obvious intent |
| **Historical Patterns** | 10% | High acceptance rate for similar suggestions |

### Classification Thresholds

```javascript
const CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLDS = {
  RESOLVABLE: 0.95,    // Resolvable suggestion (critical issues only)
  ENHANCED: 0.80,      // Enhanced comment with suggestion context
  REGULAR: 0.65,       // Regular informational comment
  SUPPRESS: 0.65       // Suppress or aggregate into summary
};
```

### Suggestion Categories by Confidence

#### Critical Confidence (≥95%) → Resolvable Suggestions
**Purpose**: Force developer decision on only the most critical, high-certainty issues
- Security vulnerabilities with definitive fixes (SQL injection, XSS, etc.)
- Null pointer exceptions with clear resolution path
- Type mismatches causing compilation errors
- Resource leaks with obvious fix patterns
- Logic errors with unambiguous corrections

#### High Confidence (80-94%) → Enhanced Comments
**Purpose**: Provide valuable suggestions without forcing resolution
- Performance optimizations with measurable impact
- Code style consistency with project standards
- Best practice recommendations with clear rationale
- Refactoring opportunities with demonstrated benefits

#### Medium Confidence (65-79%) → Regular Comments
**Purpose**: Informational feedback that adds value without pressure
- Architectural suggestions requiring discussion
- Design pattern recommendations
- Complex refactoring ideas
- Code organization improvements

#### Low Confidence (<65%) → Suppressed or Aggregated
**Purpose**: Reduce noise while preserving potentially useful insights
- Subjective style preferences
- Speculative optimizations
- Alternative implementation approaches
- Aggregated into end-of-review summary comment

## GitHub API Integration

### Suggestion Format

```markdown
```suggestion
// Fixed: Potential null pointer exception
if (user && user.profile) {
    return user.profile.name;
}
return 'Anonymous';
```
```

### API Implementation

```javascript
// Create resolvable suggestion
await octokit.rest.pulls.createReviewComment({
    owner,
    repo,
    pull_number,
    commit_id,
    path: filePath,
    position: lineNumber,
    body: `${analysisComment}\n\n\`\`\`suggestion\n${suggestedCode}\n\`\`\``
});
```

### Required Permissions
- `pull_requests: write`
- `repository_metadata: read`
- `contents: read`

## Quality Control Mechanisms

### Pre-Deployment Validation
1. **Syntax Verification**: Ensure suggested code compiles/parses
2. **Context Relevance**: Verify suggestion applies to correct code section
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Prevent multiple suggestions for same issue
4. **Rate Limiting**: Maximum resolvable suggestions per PR (recommended: 3-5)
5. **Confidence Calibration**: Validate that 95%+ confidence suggestions have >85% acceptance rate

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. **Tiered Acceptance Rate Tracking**: Monitor per confidence tier and suggestion type
2. **False Positive Detection**: Identify suggestions incorrectly promoted to resolvable status
3. **Developer Friction Analysis**: Track dismissal patterns and feedback sentiment
4. **Dynamic Threshold Optimization**: Adjust confidence thresholds based on acceptance patterns
5. **Suppressed Content Analysis**: Review suppressed suggestions for potential value recovery

## User Experience Design

### Developer Interface

#### Suggestion Presentation

**Critical Confidence (≥95%) - Resolvable Suggestion**
```
🔒 AI Security Alert (Critical - 97% Confidence)
SQL injection vulnerability detected - requires resolution

```suggestion
const sanitizedInput = escapeHtml(userInput);
```

[ Accept Suggestion ] [ Dismiss ] [ Provide Feedback ]
```

**High Confidence (80-94%) - Enhanced Comment**
```
⚡ AI Performance Suggestion (High - 87% Confidence)
Consider caching this expensive computation

```javascript
// Suggested optimization:
const memoizedResult = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(data), [data]);
```

[ 👍 Helpful ] [ 👎 Not Helpful ] [ More Info ]
```

**Medium Confidence (65-79%) - Regular Comment**
```
💡 AI Code Style Note (Medium - 72% Confidence)
Consider extracting this logic into a separate function for better readability
```

#### Batch Operations
- **Accept All Critical**: One-click acceptance of all resolvable (≥95% confidence) suggestions
- **Review Summary**: Consolidated view of all AI feedback by confidence tier
- **Filter by Category**: View suggestions by type (security, performance, style)
- **Suppressed Content Summary**: End-of-review digest of suppressed low-confidence insights

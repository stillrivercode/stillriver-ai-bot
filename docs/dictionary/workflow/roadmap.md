# roadmap

**Category**: Workflow Commands

**Definition**: When a user issues a `roadmap` command, they are asking you to create a strategic development roadmap that outlines the evolution path of a project, feature, or system over time. This command takes in context to understand the current state and generate a roadmap with phases and milestones.

## Example Prompts

- `roadmap this project based on the current codebase and requirements`
- `roadmap this API development considering these user stories and technical constraints`
- `roadmap this migration from monolith to microservices using these architecture docs`

## Expected Output Format

```markdown
# Roadmap: [Project/System Name]

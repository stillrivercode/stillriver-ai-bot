## Explanation Types

- **Concept Explanations**: Abstract ideas, principles, theories
- **Code Explanations**: How specific code works and why
- **Pattern Explanations**: Design patterns, architectural patterns
- **Process Explanations**: Workflows, algorithms, procedures
- **System Explanations**: How components interact and communicate

## Explanation Techniques

- **Top-Down**: Start with overview, then dive into details
- **Bottom-Up**: Build from basic concepts to complex systems
- **Analogies**: Use familiar concepts to explain unfamiliar ones
- **Visual Aids**: Diagrams, flowcharts, code annotations
- **Examples**: Concrete instances that illustrate abstract concepts

## Audience Considerations

- **Beginner**: Assume minimal background knowledge
- **Intermediate**: Build on existing understanding
- **Expert**: Focus on nuances and edge cases
- **Mixed Audience**: Provide multiple levels of detail

## Best Practices

- Use clear, simple language
- Provide concrete examples
- Break complex topics into digestible chunks
- Use consistent terminology throughout
- Include "why" not just "what" and "how"

# Contributing to Stillriver AI Workflows

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the Stillriver AI Workflows! It's people like you that make this such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a feature request, [make one](https://github.com/stillrivercode/stillriver-ai-workflows/issues/new/choose)! It's generally best if you get confirmation of your bug or approval for your feature request this way before starting to code.

### Fork & create a branch

If this is something you think you can fix, then [fork the repository](https://github.com/stillrivercode/stillriver-ai-workflows/fork) and create a branch with a descriptive name.

A good branch name would be (where issue #38 is the ticket you're working on):

```sh
git checkout -b 38-add-awesome-new-feature
```

### Get the style right

Your patch should follow the same conventions & pass the same code quality checks as the rest of the project.

#### Code Style
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint rules configured in the project
- Run `npm run lint` and fix any issues before submitting
- Use Prettier for code formatting
- Write tests for new functionality using Jest

#### Testing
- Run `npm test` to ensure all tests pass
- Write unit tests for new functions and modules
- Include integration tests for GitHub Actions workflows when applicable
- Test with multiple AI models when making changes to the OpenRouter integration

#### Documentation
- Update relevant documentation for any new features
- Use Information Dense Keywords (IDK) commands in examples
- Update CLAUDE.md if adding new AI capabilities
- Follow the established documentation structure

### Make a Pull Request

At this point, you should switch back to your main branch and make sure it's up to date with the main project repository:

```sh
git remote add upstream git@github.com:stillrivercode/stillriver-ai-workflows.git
git checkout main
git pull upstream main
```

Then update your feature branch from your local copy of main, and push it!

```sh
git checkout 38-add-awesome-new-feature
git rebase main
git push --set-upstream origin 38-add-awesome-new-feature
```

Finally, go to GitHub and [make a Pull Request](https://github.com/stillrivercode/stillriver-ai-workflows/compare)

### Keeping your Pull Request updated

If a maintainer asks you to "rebase" your PR, they're saying that a lot of code has changed, and that you need to update your branch so it's easier to merge.
